					Lab Report
	

		I chose to work by myself in this project.
	
	Introduction: 
		In this Lab, we were asked to Implement the Game battleboats, known as BattleShip.
	This lab was a very long and intensive lab. In the main lab, a clock runs to the event, while 
	agent loops runs. Then agent allows the message to comminicate between the PIC32 Microcontrollers.
	The game begins with either conrtoller accepting or sending a challenge, in which both players are
	prompted to a coin toss to determine who goes first. After Boats are places, the game begins.

	
	Lab Process:
		As usual, I followed the lab manual as close a possible to start the lab. Then I referenced to
	the interent for extra help on trying to understand state machines. What went well was the I already 
	had a bit of undertsanding with state machines because we had previouslty implmented them. It was really
	tedious trying to debug the code and lab files. I also had troubles with agent.c but hoping I can get some
	partial credit. I found it affective to go over lab lecture and the previous lab that went over state machines.

	Lab Overview.
		Overall, the lab was pretty interesting and a learning experience. I was able to learn how to create a little
	game on the Microcontroller. Then I was able to test the functions to see if they worked properly. I would make the lab 
	manual a bit more clear when it comes to working solo. I had trouble trying to run the python files to play the game. The
	lab manual didnt seem to specific how to test solo. This lab overall was a bit stress full, but Im glad I was able to learn
	more and develop a better understanding of state machines.
